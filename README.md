The end is the beginning is the end

What's up my friends, I'm a 2014 graduate of Augsburg College with a studio art degree. My passions
are illustrating and designing, the sport of amateur wrestling, and just learning new skills in general.
It's been a turbulent three years since graduating; lame odd jobs and not much financial success with art,
but I continue to push myself to explore new territory. About two years ago I got a wacom tablet and started
to dabble in concept art and digital illustration. I'm taking the next step now figure out how to code.
I don't know where this journey will lead to, but hopefully I'll meet some cool people and find a tech job
along the way!
